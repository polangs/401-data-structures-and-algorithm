# Singly Linked List
A linked list a linear structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguos memory locations. 

## Challenge
Write tests to prove the following functionality:

* Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
*   Can properly insert into the linked list
* The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
* Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
* Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
* Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
* Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
