# Reverse an Array
   This method reverses an array.

## Challenge
  This code challenge Reverse an Array, lets you create a method that accepts an array, get the length of the array and iterate through the array from the beginning to the end and should return a new set of reversed array.  

## Approach & Efficiency
  I reviewed the starter code and used our whiteboard picture to follow the steps I need to take to put it into code. After a few minutes of poking around and not getting the output I wanted. I did a little research to get me moving and finally get to run it with the reversed array within 15mins.
