    Binary Search in a Sorted 1D Array

## Challenge
   This challenge should take in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index, of the array's element that is equal to the search key , or -1 if the element does not exist. 

## Approach & Efficiency
  I had to read the task multiple times to think of the problem domain, identify the input and the output, did visuals and wrote down the algorithm and pseudo code.
  Read Binary Search on Wikipedia and asked questions from TA.
